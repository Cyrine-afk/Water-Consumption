# Water Consumption
Exploring, cleaning and wrangling a water consumption dataset using python and pandas library, in order to obtain clean data. This is data is modeled and visualized in a Power BI dashboard.  
# Company Description 
SFM Technologies is an engineering and expertise firm in telecommunications networks and information technologies.  
The company carries out engineering and consulting missions in order to meet the organizational challenges of development and digital transformation of Telecommunications Regulators, Network Operators, Ministries of Telecommunications and Frequency Agencies. 
# Problem & Provided Solution
More than 5 IoT sensors are distributed only in the 2nd floor of the company. The sensors allow to follow the water consumption by collecting the information on the flow every 15 seconds during 9 months, which means to have a huge database, we can neither visualize these consumptions nor interpret the results of each consumption.

With the solution we proposed, we can finally visualize the analysis of consumption data on a readable dashboard, and then give users the opportunity to make decisions about the analysis results in order to improve their water consumption and practices.
